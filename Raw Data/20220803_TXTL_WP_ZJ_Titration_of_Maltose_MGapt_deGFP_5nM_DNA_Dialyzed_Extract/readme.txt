Description: In collaboration with William Poole and Zoila Jurado, I am doing experiments to probe cell extract metabolism.
In this experiment and subsequent experiments, we vary the amount of fuel we are using at the following levels: 5mM, 10mM,
15mM, 20mM, 30mM, and 45mM. We are effectively performing a panel of fuel vs Mg to understand the complex interplay between
fuel and magnesium. We use a Jupyter notebook to compute the final concentrations of these components in the TXTL 
reaction mixture. 
	We create the following solutions for our experiments: a minimal energy solution without 3-PGA and NTPs; ATP 
solution, GTP solution, NTP solution, 3-PGA solution (from Miki), pyruvate solution, succinate solution, and maltose
solution. We also create a malachite green solution to measure mRNA dynamics.
	In this experiment, we perform a maltose vs Magnesium panel, albeit unlike the 20220513 expt, we use 5nM DNA 
template instead of 1nM and we use a dialyzed, French-pressed extract. Here we use a newly prepared batch of energy
solution. Here we also note a newly prepared NTP solution but do not use it yet.

Experiment Protocol:
	1. Create a minimal master mix that will be added to all samples. 
	The composition is computed from the same Jupyter notebook used to create the Echo picklist.
	   (108 samples * 7.266uL/sample * 1.1 excess = 863uL)
		Component				Protocol Amount (uL)
		---------				--------------------
		Extract					392 (15 tubes)
		PEG (40%)				59.40
		Minimal energy sol. (24.862 x)		47.78
		Amino acids				297
		K(3000mM)				31.68
		Malachite Green Dye			23.76
		NTPs (500mM)				11.51
	2. We use the Echo to load whatever is not in the minimal master mix into our sample wells, as defined by
	   our Echo picklist. We make sure to leave one well space between wells with different samples.
		Source Well		Component			Volume (uL)
		-----------	-------------------------		-----------
		    M01		Maltose, diluted 3X to 467mM		65	
		    M02		Maltose, diluted 3X to 467mM		30
