# README

This repository contains all data for main and supplementary figures for the paper titled "Metabolic perturbations to an E. coli-based cell-free system reveal a trade-off between transcription and translation." In addition to data, we have included the code used for tidying the data, combining it into a single large comma-separated values (CSV) file, creating figures, and computing correlation coefficients. We have also included DNA sequences for the plasmids used in this study that were not under a material transfer agreement (MTA).

The environment.yml file in the Analysis folder provides information on the Python environment used for analysis and plotting of data.
